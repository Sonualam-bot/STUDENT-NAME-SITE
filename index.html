    Hi I am Sonu !

    I am BCA 4th semester student. 
    Currently learning from Tanay Pratap the professor
    who teaches and makes learning exceptionally simple.
    To me learning code is everything at this point of time.

    Now i am going to deploy. 
    Wish me luck!


    I have worked on some CLI apps . I'll showcase here tomorrow.
